This mod makes the circular saw from the moreblocks mod available to mods
residing in the MCL world (MineClone2/VoxelLibre, MineClonia).

You need to install the moreblocks mod as well. This is just a compatibility
layer.

It just adds the saw including receipe. All blocks from the respective
MCL game that are registered as slabs in that game normally are added
to the saw.

Beware: If you use MineClone2/VoxelLibre, you may have to replace the
screwdriver as the one it currently comes with is far too limited.
MineClonia does not have this problem.
